    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/[module]-[feature-name]
    ```

2. Regular commits with descriptive messages

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat(module): implemented specific feature"
    ```

3. Pull requests to the `dev` branch with proper descriptions

    - Include what was changed
    - Note any breaking changes
    - Reference related issues

4. Code review by at least one other team member

5. Integration testing before merging to `main`

## Communication & Coordination

-   Daily stand-up meetings (15 minutes)
-   Weekly progress reviews
-   Shared documentation in the project wiki
-   Issue tracking in GitHub Projects board
-   Direct communication for integration points
