## üîÑ Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client Browser/App] <-->|HTTP/HTTPS Requests| B[Express.js Server]
    B <-->|Authentication| C[JWT Auth Middleware]
    B <-->|Database Operations| D[MongoDB]
    B <-->|File Operations| E[Cloudinary]
    C --> F[Role-Based Access Control]
    F --> G{User Role}
    G --> H[Admin Routes]
    G --> I[Teacher Routes]
    G --> J[Student Routes]
```

1. Client makes authenticated requests to backend API
2. JWT middleware validates token and extracts user info
3. Role middleware checks permissions for the requested resource
4. Controllers process the request and interact with the database
5. Data is returned to client with appropriate formatting
6. File uploads are processed through Cloudinary

## üîê Security Implementation

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based with proper expiration
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Protection**:
    - Password hashing with bcrypt
    - Sensitive data encryption
    - HTTPS for all communications
4. **Input Validation**:
    - Server-side validation with express-validator
    - Client-side validation for user experience
5. **File Security**:
    - Type validation
    - Size limits
    - Secure storage with Cloudinary
6. **API Protection**:
    - Rate limiting
    - CORS configuration
    - Helmet.js security headers
