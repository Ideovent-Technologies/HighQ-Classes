## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges & Recommendations

### üß© **1. Critical Path Dependencies**

-   **Challenge:** Authentication System is foundational.
-   **Recommendation:** Allocate additional help for Avinash, especially early in development, to de-risk delays.

---

### üîó **2. Integration Complexity**

-   **Challenge:** Student Records (Gauri) has multiple dependencies and high integration needs.
-   **Recommendation:** Define and agree on API contracts early to avoid integration bottlenecks.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è **3. Workload Balance**

-   **Observation:** Notice & Announcements (Hardik) appears lighter in workload.
-   **Recommendation:** Assign Hardik additional responsibilities such as the **Email Notification System** or assisting with integration tasks.

---

### ‚è≥ **4. One-Month Timeline Constraints**

-   **Challenge:** Completing complex modules within 1 month is ambitious.
-   **Recommendation:**

    -   Develop a **week-by-week milestone plan**.
    -   Focus on incremental feature delivery.

---

### üîÑ **5. Integration Phase Risk**

-   **Challenge:** Only 5 days allocated for integration.
-   **Recommendation:**

    -   Apply **continuous integration practices**.
    -   Schedule **mid-sprint integration checkpoints** to catch issues early.
