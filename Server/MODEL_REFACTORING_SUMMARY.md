# Model Structure Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We have successfully refactored the HighQ Classes backend from a complex User-based relationship model to simple, independent models. This eliminates the confusion and complexity that was causing authentication and profile access issues.

## Previous Structure (❌ Complex)

```
User Model (Base Authentication)
├── Admin Model (Admin-specific data, references User)
├── Teacher Model (Teacher-specific data, references User)
├── Student Model (Student-specific data, references User)
```

**Problems:**

-   Required two documents for each user (User + Role-specific model)
-   Complex relationships and population queries
-   Authentication worked, but profile access failed due to missing relationships
-   Confusing endpoint structure (User ID vs Role-specific ID)

## New Structure (✅ Simple)

```
Independent Models:
├── Student Model (Complete student data + authentication)
├── Teacher Model (Complete teacher data + authentication)
├── Admin Model (Complete admin data + authentication)
```

**Benefits:**

-   Single document per user
-   Direct authentication and profile access
-   Clear, role-specific endpoints
-   No complex relationships

## Files Modified

### 1. Models Updated

-   **`models/Student.js`**: Now independent with authentication fields
-   **`models/Teacher.js`**: Now independent with authentication fields
-   **`models/Admin.js`**: Now independent with authentication fields

### 2. Authentication Middleware Updated

-   **`middleware/authMiddleware.js`**:
    -   Updated to work with independent models
    -   Removed debug logging
    -   Simplified authorization logic

### 3. Controllers Updated

-   **`controllers/authController.js`**:

    -   Updated registration to create role-specific documents
    -   Updated login to search across all models
    -   Proper token generation with role information

-   **`controllers/studentController.js`**:
    -   Updated to find student by ID directly (no User reference)
    -   Simplified profile retrieval

### 4. Security Features Added

All models now include:

-   Password hashing with bcrypt
-   JWT token generation
-   Login attempt tracking and account locking
-   Password reset functionality
-   Email verification
-   Account status management

## New Endpoint Structure

### Student Endpoints

-   `POST /api/auth/register` - Register student with `role: "student"`
-   `POST /api/auth/login` - Login student
-   `GET /api/student/:studentId/profile` - Get student profile

### Teacher Endpoints

-   `POST /api/auth/register` - Register teacher with `role: "teacher"`
-   `POST /api/auth/login` - Login teacher
-   Teacher-specific endpoints (to be updated)

### Admin Endpoints

-   `POST /api/auth/register` - Register admin with `role: "admin"`
-   `POST /api/auth/login` - Login admin
-   Admin-specific endpoints (to be updated)

## Testing the New Structure

### 1. Registration Example

```json
POST /api/auth/register
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "mobile": "1234567890",
    "role": "student",
    "parentName": "Jane Doe",
    "parentContact": "0987654321",
    "grade": "10th",
    "schoolName": "ABC School"
}
```

### 2. Login Example

```json
POST /api/auth/login
{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

### 3. Profile Access

```
GET /api/student/{studentId}/profile
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Database Migration Notes

### Before Migration

```javascript
// Check existing data
db.users.find();
db.students.find();
db.teachers.find();
db.admins.find();
```

### After Migration

-   Old `users` collection can be archived/removed
-   Each role now has its own collection with complete data
-   No more complex relationships

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new structure** using the provided test script
2. **Update remaining controllers** (Teacher, Admin) to work with new models
3. **Update frontend** to use new authentication flow
4. **Migrate existing data** if any (create migration script if needed)
5. **Update team documentation** with new endpoint structure

## Files to Update Next

### Controllers that need updating:

-   `controllers/teacherController.js`
-   `controllers/adminController.js`
-   Any other controllers that reference the old User model

### Routes that might need updating:

-   Teacher routes
-   Admin routes
-   Any middleware that expects the old structure

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ **Simplified Authentication**: Direct login to role-specific models
2. ✅ **Clear Profile Access**: No more User ID vs Role ID confusion
3. ✅ **Better Performance**: No complex population queries
4. ✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth per role
5. ✅ **Better Security**: Role-specific authentication and authorization
6. ✅ **Cleaner Code**: No more complex relationship management

The refactoring successfully resolves the "Student profile not found" issue and provides a much cleaner, more maintainable architecture.
