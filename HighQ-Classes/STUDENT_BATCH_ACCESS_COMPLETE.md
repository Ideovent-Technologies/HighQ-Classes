## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Student Batch Access Flow:
Admin → Creates Course → Creates Batch → Assigns Students
Student → Logs In → Sees Assigned Batch → Accesses Content

Data Flow:
1. Admin assigns student to batch (backend)
2. Student.batch field updated with batch reference
3. Student login → batchService.getStudentBatch() → Returns batch info
4. Student accesses materials/recordings/assignments filtered by batch
```

## 🔄 Backend Integration

The implementation leverages existing backend endpoints:

-   **Batch Assignment**: Uses admin-controlled enrollment process
-   **Content Filtering**: Materials/recordings/assignments filtered by student's batch
-   **Access Control**: JWT-based authentication ensures students only see their batch content

## 📱 User Experience

### For Students:

1. **Dashboard**: Clear batch overview with quick access buttons
2. **Batch Page**: Comprehensive batch information and navigation
3. **Materials**: Filtered, searchable materials with view tracking
4. **Navigation**: Intuitive sidebar with batch-first approach

### For Admins:

1. **Enrollment Process**: Create course → batch → assign students
2. **Content Management**: Upload materials visible to specific batches
3. **Analytics**: Track student material views and engagement
